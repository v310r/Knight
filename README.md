This project only supports Windows. To support other platforms build settings should be tuned.

To build the project, you should firstly build SFML library. Run cmake in the build folder as it is shown in the picture below:

Then, go to the root folder and run GenerateProject.bat. Open a solution, choose whatever configuration you'd prefer (Debug or Release) and build the whole solution.

Now you you should be able to play the game, enjoy :-).
